# Pong in C#

Created by Jared Chudzinski

Inital code written following mooICT tutorial

Will be updated over time
Goals:

Updated CPU (with adequate difficulty level)

2 player mode ##Complete!!

Title screen with options for 1 or 2 players **Complete!!

.exe or other kind of executable so my friends can download and play it. 
2 players over a server

I do not know how feasible these goals are as this is my first major 
stint with c# but listing the goals will give me a road map to continue 
to practice c# and make the game better
